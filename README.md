# Random Dot Motion Experiment Modification

## Description
This repository contains HW 7: A modified version of our in-class experiment.

## Modifications
- Added difficulty selection (easy vs hard) in the dialog box in the beginning, corresponding to different coherence levels.
- Added feedback ("Correct(Green)"/"Wrong(Red)") after each trial (I know typically we do not give them feedbacks during the experiment, but I think this can be an interesting modification.)

## How to Run
Run `DotStim_hw.py` in Psychopy.
